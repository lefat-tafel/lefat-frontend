# Lefat

Everyone knows food banks: People in need can go to a special place and receive
food that they can take home. But since COVID-19 those places do not open
anymore.

This is where lefat comes into play: When you can't come to the food, the food
will come to you!

Lefat is a tool for food banks where volunteers and those in
need can register and volunteers can plan delivery tours to bring the food to
those in need. Volunteers select waypoints and lefat will use privacy friendly
services to calculate a tour from delivery spot to delivery spot.

Lefat allows to manage vehicles, volunteers and tours and helps the food banks
to spend more time handing out food.
